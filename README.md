🎮 Motion Sickness Simulation in Unity
A Unity-based research and simulation project that studies motion sickness in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. This application simulates various movement conditions and user interactions that may induce or reduce motion sickness, providing a foundation for further study and development of comfort-enhancing VR techniques.

🧠 Overview
This project is designed for VR headsets (e.g., Oculus Quest, HTC Vive) and allows controlled experimentation with:

Different locomotion techniques

Visual feedback cues

Field of View (FoV) adjustments

Acceleration/deceleration profiles

Comfort settings (vignetting, snap turning, teleportation)

🛠️ Built With
Unity (Version 2020.3+ or 2021+)

XR Interaction Toolkit

Unity XR Plugin Management

Oculus/SteamVR Integration

C# Scripting

Shader Graph (optional for visual effects)

🎯 Key Features
🌀 Simulate user motion with variable speed, acceleration, and turning

🎯 Compare locomotion methods: smooth locomotion, teleportation, dash, snap turn

🔍 Adjustable comfort settings like vignetting and FoV restrictors

🧪 Record user feedback on nausea/discomfort levels (optional UI)

🔧 Modular settings to toggle effects for testing different hypothes
